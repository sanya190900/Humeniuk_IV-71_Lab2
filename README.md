# Humeniuk Oleksandr Group IV-71 Gradebook - IV7104
In Lab2 I created class TimeOH(OH -â†’ Oleksandr Humeniuk), which contains 3 fields(hours, minutes, seconds), 3 methods(overrided toString(), sum() and diff()) - task 6

Also class contains 2 static methods (sum() and diff()) - task 7

I created 3 different objects using 3 different ways - task 8

Every method was tested and I got correct results - tasks 9, 10

# Note : time is printed in 12-hour format(AM/PM) without compensating zeros.
